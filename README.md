# About these guidelines

The first version of these room hosting guidelines were written for PgConf
Europe 2022. An important rewrite was made by Afsane Anand to be used in PgConf
Germany 2024. As you will read, several parts make only sense in Postgres
conferences, like the reference to the room bag. The guidelines are in no way
official guidelines of Postgres Europe, nor of any other Postgres event or
organization. They are free to use or be modified if you want a starting point
for your event. Improvements are welcome.
